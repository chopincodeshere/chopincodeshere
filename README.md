  <h3>👨‍💻 Coding Enthusiast | 🎸 Guitarist | 🏀 Sportsman</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Hey there! 👋 I'm Jil, a coder who turns ideas into digital reality by day. Beyond the keyboard, I'm apassionate guitarist, lost in the rhythmic blend of melodies. Music is my creative outlet, a space where I
        explore and express emotions beyond lines of code.</p>

  <p>When not coding or playing tunes, I'm on the sports field 🏀. Whether it's the adrenaline rush of basketball or the strategy of chess, I love the thrill of competition. Eager to learn and connect, I'm always up for new challenges and meeting amazing people. Let's chat about code, share music vibes, or discuss the latest sports highlights. Excited for the journey ahead! 🚀</p>
